// ninfer::ops - two- and four-device collectives.
//
// These are the cross-device primitives tensor-parallel forward passes need: one
// summing reduction for row-parallel projections, one row gather for the vocabulary-split output
// head. Both operate on an ExecutionContext holding two or four DeviceContexts and use each
// device's own compute stream; no stream parameter is accepted, because "the stream a device
// executes on" is already a property of its DeviceContext and a second, disagreeing stream story
// would break the ordering guarantees documented below.
//
// TRANSPORT. Gather and large/fallback reduction payloads move with
// cudaMemcpyAsync(cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice) over unified virtual
// addresses, which every 64-bit Linux CUDA context has: a device pointer already names its
// device, so this one entry point expresses a cross-device transfer as well as a local one. When
// the driver grants peer access and startup validates it, the copy is a direct device-to-device
// PCIe transfer. On this V100 topology the translated IOMMU domain prevents direct P2P; CUDA's
// UVA D2D implementation then selects its driver-managed staging path. Startup validates the
// exact UVA D2D route in either case. The collectives never allocate or copy through an explicit
// host buffer, and callers need no peer-access branch; enable_peer_access() only reports whether
// direct peer access was qualified.
// Small qualified SM70 allreduces may read the peer operand directly in a sum kernel, writing
// only their own staging. Both reads retire before either original operand is overwritten.
//
// The equivalent cudaMemcpyPeerAsync entry point is deliberately NOT used: it is rejected inside a
// stream capture region (cudaErrorStreamCaptureUnsupported), which would make the whole
// tensor-parallel decode program uncapturable. See src/ops/common/allreduce.cu's pull_peer().
//
// The pairwise choreography below describes TP2. TP4 waits for every other rank's
// inputs_ready before reading and every other rank's pull_done before overwriting
// a source. Both routes retain the operands until all reads retire; TP4 sums in
// global rank order so replicated residuals remain bit-identical across ranks.
// ORDERING. Every transfer is a PULL: rank r reads the peer's source into storage that rank r
// alone owns, on rank r's own stream. Nothing a rank owns is ever written by the peer's stream, so
// the classic push hazard -- the peer overwriting a staging buffer that this rank has not finished
// reading yet -- cannot exist. Each rank issues two event records and two event waits:
//
//   stream(r):  ...producer of the rank-r inputs...
//               record(inputs_ready[r])
//               wait(inputs_ready[1-r])              // peer's source is complete
//               peer source -> rank-r storage
//               record(pull_done[r])
//               wait(pull_done[1-r])                 // peer has finished reading MY source
//               ...local combine, for allreduce_sum...
//
// The two waits carry the whole correctness argument:
//
//   * wait(inputs_ready[1-r]) makes the inbound copy read a completed peer source, both within a
//     call and across calls -- in call k+1 that event is recorded after call k's local work on the
//     peer's stream, so the next pull cannot start before the previous call finished with the
//     source it reads.
//   * wait(pull_done[1-r]) is the write-after-read barrier for THIS rank's own source: it
//     guarantees the peer has finished reading rank r's buffer before rank r (or the caller, on
//     return) overwrites it. For allreduce_sum that protects the in-place combine; for both ops it
//     is what makes back-to-back calls that reuse the same buffers safe.
//
// POST-CONDITION. On return each rank's stream is ordered after the peer's read of that rank's
// inputs. Therefore an unbounded sequence of calls sharing the same buffers, staging, and
// PeerEvents needs NO host synchronization between calls -- which is exactly what a captured
// CUDA graph replays, and what a decode token's collectives do. For the 27B model that is
// 128 all-reduces (64 layers x 2 row-parallel projections: the mixer output and the MLP down
// projection) plus one allgather_rows per logit column, so 129 collectives at batch 1.
//
// Everything in a call is stream-ordered CUDA work (memcpy, event record, event wait, kernel
// launch): there is no host round trip, host-memory spin flag, or explicit host staging allocation
// in the hot path. That is what makes the sequence capturable. Measured: with both device streams
// enrolled in ONE capture -- the peer's stream joined to the origin's by an event fork -- the record/wait pairs
// above become graph EDGES rather than nodes, and the whole 128-collective decode program
// instantiates as a single cross-device cudaGraphExec. Event objects are caller-owned and created
// once, because cudaEventCreate is not capturable.
//
// CALLER OBLIGATION -- the legacy default stream. These ops read their inputs on
// DeviceContext::stream, which core creates with cudaStreamNonBlocking and which therefore does
// NOT implicitly synchronize with a device's legacy default stream. Work issued with the plain
// cudaMemcpy/cudaMemset/<<<...>>> forms (no stream argument) lands on that default stream and is
// unordered against these collectives. A caller that stages inputs that way must retire them
// first (a device or stream synchronize, or an event); producing the inputs on
// DeviceContext::stream needs no extra step. This trap is invisible in single-device code, where
// the default stream orders everything.
//
// After a call returns the work is enqueued but not complete; the caller synchronizes each
// device's own stream, or lets subsequent stream-ordered work depend on it, as usual.
