/**
 * Op: linear_add
 *
 * Math / indexing:
 *   ideal[:,t] = residual[:,t] + Linear(x,w)[:,t].
 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   Contiguous BF16 x [K,T] and residual [N,T]. Registered weights are GGML_K `ggml-k256-v1`,
 *   Q5G64_F16S RowSplit
 *   [5120,17408] or [5120,6144], W8G32_F16S RowSplit [2048,4096] or [2048,6144], NVFP4
 *   BlockScaleK16M128x4 [5120,6144] or [5120,17408], row-scaled
 *   FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16S [5120,6144] or [5120,17408], or BF16_CTRL Contiguous [5120,6144]. T may
 *   be any positive value.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle reads a registered BF16 weight directly or exact-decodes a registered packed
 *   weight, then evaluates `ideal` naively in FP64 from the represented inputs. The updated BF16
 *   residual is promoted and compared directly with that result; output storage rounding belongs
 *   to LinearAdd's selected A16, A8, or A4 criterion, not the oracle. Production routes may fuse
 *   or materialize the projection and may choose their natural accumulator, activation
 *   quantization, staging, and workspace precision; those private choices are not semantic
 *   rounding boundaries.
 *
 * Compute policy:
 *   GGML_K, Q5, W8, and BF16_CTRL admit only A16Only. NVFP4 admits A16Only and AllowA4. Row-scaled FP8
 *   admits A16Only and AllowA8. Its two semantic registrations own independent production plans:
 *   [5120,6144] resolves T<22 to A16 and T>=22 to A8, while [5120,17408] resolves T<25 to A16 and
 *   T>=25 to A8. A permissive policy allows the private resolver to select either qualified
 *   arithmetic profile; it does not itself prescribe a kernel.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Updates the full residual tensor in place; x/weight must not alias residual.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage reported by linear_add_workspace_capacity_bytes(), scoped to
 *   the call. Query the selected profile even for A16: Volta routes can require projection,
 *   split-K, or dequantization storage. Other routes may have a static-zero requirement.
 *   There is no persistent state side effect.

// --- Tensor-parallel split form (tp == 2 or 4) ------------------------------------------------
// All spans have exactly ec.tp entries. Only registered per-format shard shapes are admitted;
// accepting a four-rank context does not register an otherwise unsupported weight geometry.
// Staging follows allreduce_sum: one output contribution per rank at TP2, four at TP4.
//
// Rank r owns BF16 x[r] [K_r,T], weight w[r] [N,K_r], and the replicated incoming residual
// [N,T]. The complete mathematical oracle is residual_in + sum_r W_r @ x_r, evaluated directly
// in FP64 from represented BF16 inputs and independently decoded packed weights. Internal
// partial storage/reduction rounding is an implementation profile, not an oracle boundary.
//
// Rank 0 folds the residual into its partial exactly once; all other ranks overwrite their
// copies with residual-free projections. The one allreduce_sum leaves the full residual on
// every rank. BF16_CTRL composes plain Linear and residual_add using staging's first plane;
// registered packed formats use their fused LinearAdd route on rank 0. There are no per-rank
// residual additions after the reduction and no extra hot-path allocation.
//
// Ranks agree on token count, output extent N and weight format/layout. K_r may differ. Input
// and output residency/stream requirements are the same as linear_row_parallel. GGML_K,
// NVFP4, Q5G64_F16S, row-scaled FP8 and BF16_CTRL are admitted only at their registered shapes.
